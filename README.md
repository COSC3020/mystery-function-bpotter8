# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```

The mystery function returns the largest value of an array. It uses recursion to go through the entire array, and replaces the foo variable with the maximum value each time a new one is found.
